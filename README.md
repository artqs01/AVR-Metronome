# AVR-Metronome
This is the code for my DIY digital metronome running on AVR microprocessor.

Metronome should provide functionality of complete and accurate digital metronome whith polyrhythms, clave and custom metronome maps with
posibillity to change tempo, pitch and subdivisions after every measure.

Project is inspired by every metronome mobile app that doesn't have consistent tempo and crashes every 10 minutes :)
